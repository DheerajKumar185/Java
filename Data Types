Data Type:
	In java every variable and every expression has some type. Each and every data type is clearly defined. Every assignment should be checked by compiler for type compatibility.
	Because of above reason we can conclude java language is strongly typed programing language.

Java is not considered as pure object oriented programming language Because several oops feature are not satisfied by java like (operator overloading, multiple inheritance, etc.). More over we are depending on primitive data types which are non objects.

Primitive data types.
	Numeric data types
	Non Numeric data types.
