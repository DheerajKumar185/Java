Identifier: A name in the java program is called an identifier which can be used for identification purposes. It can be a class name, method name, variable name or label name.
only allowed characters in java identifiers are: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, $, _

Note:
1. Identifier can't start with digits/number
2. We can differentiate the case so number=10, Number=10, NUMBER=10 all are allowed and valid identifier.
3. No length limit for java identifiers.
4. We can't use the reserved word as an identifier.
5. All predefined java class name and interface name we can use as identifiers like below.
int String=888; int Runnable=999;
Even these are valid but it's not good programming practice because it reduces the readability and creates confusion.
